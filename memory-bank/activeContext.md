# VisionFit Active Context

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: Initial Memory Bank Setup  
**Phase**: Foundation & Core Development  
**Primary Focus**: Exercise tracking with pose detection and voice integration

## Active Work Areas

### 1. Exercise Tracking System
**Current Implementation**: 
- Basic pose detection using MLKit
- Bicep curl rep counting (left/right hand tracking)
- Real-time form feedback with visual indicators
- Camera session management with front/back switching

**Status**: Core functionality implemented, needs refinement

### 2. Voice Assistant Integration
**Current Implementation**:
- Pipecat client for voice streaming
- Exercise data transmission to AI coach
- Real-time feedback delivery with throttling
- Connection management and status tracking

**Status**: Basic integration complete, needs testing and optimization

### 3. User Interface
**Current Implementation**:
- Home dashboard with exercise selection
- Exercise tracker view with camera preview
- Progress metrics display (weight, height, calories, BMI)
- Chat interface integration

**Status**: Core UI complete, needs polish and optimization

## Recent Developments
1. **Pose Detection Pipeline**: MLKit integration with real-time landmark processing
2. **Voice Streaming**: Pipecat client implementation for AI coaching
3. **Exercise Logic**: Rep counting algorithm for bicep curls
4. **UI Framework**: SwiftUI-based modular architecture

## Immediate Next Steps

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Form Feedback Enhancement**: Improve body alignment detection accuracy
2. **Voice Coaching**: Refine feedback messages and timing
3. **Exercise Expansion**: Add push-up and squat detection logic
4. **UI Polish**: Smooth animations and visual feedback improvements

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce latency and improve frame rate
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery for camera/voice failures
3. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on exercise detection accuracy
4. **Progress Tracking**: Implement data persistence and historical charts

## Current Challenges

### Technical Issues
1. **Latency**: Voice feedback timing needs optimization (currently 3-second throttling)
2. **Accuracy**: Form detection needs refinement for complex poses
3. **Battery Usage**: Continuous camera processing optimization needed
4. **Connection Stability**: Voice assistant reconnection logic

### User Experience
1. **Onboarding**: Need tutorial for camera positioning
2. **Feedback Clarity**: Visual indicators could be more intuitive
3. **Exercise Variety**: Limited to bicep curls currently
4. **Progress Visualization**: Charts need more detailed data

## Decisions Made
1. **MLKit over Custom Models**: Better performance and maintenance
2. **SwiftUI over UIKit**: Modern development approach
3. **Pipecat for Voice**: Established voice streaming solution
4. **Modular Architecture**: Feature-based organization

## Pending Decisions
1. **Data Storage Strategy**: Local vs. cloud for progress tracking
2. **Exercise Model Expansion**: Custom training vs. pre-built solutions
3. **Voice Provider**: Current vs. alternative voice AI services
4. **Monetization**: Free vs. premium features strategy

## Key Files Currently Active
- `ExerciseTrackerView.swift` - Main exercise interface
- `ExerciseTrackerViewModel.swift` - Exercise logic and pose detection
- `HomeView.swift` - Dashboard and navigation
- `CameraPreview.swift` - Camera session management
- Voice integration components in `/VoiceStream/`

## Testing Priorities
1. **Exercise Accuracy**: Validate rep counting across different users
2. **Voice Quality**: Test coaching effectiveness and clarity
3. **Performance**: Monitor frame rate and battery usage
4. **User Flow**: End-to-end workout session testing
