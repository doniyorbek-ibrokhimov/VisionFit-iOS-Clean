# VisionFit Project Brief

## Overview
VisionFit is an iOS fitness application that leverages computer vision and AI to provide real-time exercise tracking, form correction, and interactive coaching through voice assistance.

## Core Mission
Transform fitness training by providing intelligent, real-time feedback on exercise form using pose detection technology, combined with AI-powered voice coaching for a comprehensive fitness experience.

## Primary Goals
1. **Real-time Exercise Tracking**: Use MLKit Pose Detection to track and count exercise repetitions with high accuracy
2. **Form Correction**: Provide immediate feedback on exercise form and body alignment
3. **Voice Coaching**: Interactive voice-based coaching and encouragement during workouts
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track fitness metrics (weight, height, calories, BMI) over time
5. **User Experience**: Deliver a modern, intuitive interface that motivates users

## Key Features
- **Exercise Detection**: Support for bicep curls, push-ups, squats with ML-powered pose detection
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual and voice feedback on exercise form and alignment
- **Voice Interaction**: AI voice assistant for motivation and guidance
- **Progress Charts**: Visual tracking of fitness metrics over time
- **Camera Integration**: Front/back camera switching for optimal exercise tracking

## Target Platform
- iOS 15.0+
- Swift/SwiftUI implementation
- Google MLKit for pose detection
- Voice streaming capabilities through Pipecat integration

## Success Criteria
- Accurate exercise counting (>95% accuracy)
- Real-time form feedback (<1 second latency)
- Intuitive user interface with smooth animations
- Reliable voice assistant integration
- Comprehensive progress tracking

## Technical Constraints
- Must work offline for core pose detection
- Real-time processing requirements
- Camera privacy and permissions handling
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
